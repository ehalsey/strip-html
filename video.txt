hi everyone today we're here to talk about the economic development administration's build to skill program
particularly for fiscal year 2023.
during today's webinar we're going to discuss a little bit about the history of the program some background on the
build-a-scale program overview including the two different challenges and walk
through an in-depth look at how to apply
the build-a-scale program was authorized under the Stevenson Wilder technology Act of 1980 so under Section 27 this
gives us our overarching program goals that we try to achieve which include
supporting planning and technical assistance of regional Innovation initiatives to improve connectedness and
strategic orientation of the regional Innovation initiative increase availability and investment of private
and philanthropic financing and facilitate commercialization of products and processes technology
transfer and entrepreneurial activities so these are the goals we're trying to meet under the built-to-scale program
design for those who may not know built a scale has been around for the past nine years
since 2014. we're very very excited to say in 2023 that this will be our 10th
time running this competition and this year we've been appropriated 50 million
dollars for the program which is the most we've ever had appropriated so we're very excited for this year's
competition a little bit more about the history of the program so over the last nine years
we've been able to fund 378 individual projects under the bill to scale program
which is over 220 one million dollars of Eda investment
we've seen over 250 million dollars 54 million dollars of local match provided
and created over 58 000 jobs estimated
since 2020 alone the build-a-scale program has seen over 240 investment deals for startup
participants and 262 million dollars in private investment
um which has led to over 270 obtained impending patents trademarks and copyrights so we're excited to see what
the next cohort of applicants will produce as well and continue to build on this
when we think about what goes into building a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem there's a number of things
this is a simplified view of that but what builds a scale with built a skill we like to think of it as the
intersection of business support and Innovation engines we want to continue to support Regional Innovation economies
but also still support businesses uh where they are
again thinking about the entrepreneurial ecosystem there's a lot of players involved
when we think about who is a good fit for the build to scale program we tend
to think about the entrepreneurial support organizations these are the intermediary organizations providing
Direct Services to entrepreneurs and scalable tech-based startup companies
this program does not allow funding to go directly to entrepreneurs or to the
startup companies so we're really looking at those intermediaries who are going to provide the programming to
support them technically speaking we do have more
strict parameters on eligibility requirements than that last slide may have depicted which includes we have
public and non-public entities on the public entity side eligible entities include states or cities Indian tribes
or other political subdivisions of a state so think municipalities counties
Etc on the non-public entity side we have non-profit organizations institutions of
higher education which can include community colleges universities public or private Etc
public-private Partnerships if you are or interested becoming a public private
partnership I highly highly encourage you to read the footnotes in the notice of funding opportunity aka the nofo
because it will explain in detail what is required to be considered a public priority partnership under this grant
also open to science or research Parks Federal Laboratories Venture development organizations or economic development
organizations or similar entity that is focused excuse me primarily on improving
science Technology Innovation or entrepreneurship I will note here briefly and I'll talk
about it later that public and non-public entities do have different application requirements please please
read the nofo at the appendices there is a checklist uh one for public entities
and one for non-public entities of what goes into your application specifically so make sure you know which category
your entity falls under separately if you'd like to apply as a
consortia of any of these listed entities that is allowed you can apply as a consortia as well no matter if you
are a public or non-public entity this program does require a 50 match requirement so that means every dollar
of Eda investment you request that you must also provide a one dollar match
requirement as well what are the program goals so the
program goals for build-a-scale we talked about the Stevenson welder Act and the overarching goals so more
specifically what is build the skill trying to achieve we are trying to build capacity for innovators to invent
improve and bring to Market new products and services we're looking to expand Regional knowledge ecosystems and
realize economic and job growth we are looking for programs that will
accelerate Regional economies focused on industries of the future of
course looking to catalyze Regional leadership through technology-based Economic Development also known as t-bed
strategies empowering communities to provide proof of concept and commercialization
assistance and of course equitably and inclusively increase access to capital for technology-enabled entrepreneurs
so for 2023 as I noted we have 50 million dollars of funding how are we
going to break that down well we have two separate challenges The Venture
Challenge and the capital challenge I'm gonna talk more about each of these
individually shortly but wanted to start with this graphic to kind of show how it works to build the skill program is
inclusive of the two different challenges and under each challenge there are various funding levels
we're really trying to help meet communities where they are you don't have to be super mature of a community
or super advanced in t-bed to apply for a build-a-scale program so we want to make sure that there's different funding
levels available to help address and meet communities where they are and address what their
needs are today we're going to start with the Venture challenge so the Venture challenge is
really a programmatic grant ready for implementation for communities
that are ready to implement and designed to provide entrepreneurial support organizations funding to accelerate
stable scalable startup companies what does that look like so as I've noted we
have nine years of programs you can check our website to learn more and see
past descriptions of some of our different grantees in the past but what we've tended to see in our past grantees
is we've seen a lot of models that support technology incubation or accelerator models we've seen coaching
we've seen technology transfer and commercialization programming and of
course programming that catalyzes Regional technology-based Economic Development AKA t-bed strategies as well
so under the Venture challenge we have three funding tiers I'm gonna skip ignite for a minute since it's new to
fiscal year 2023 so we'll talk about that one separately and I'm going to
skip down to build and scale which you might be a little bit more familiar with under the build level we're really
looking for applicants who are going to be piloting a new model or implementing a proven solution you can request up to
750 000 over a federal share over a three-year period of performance I
should note you do not have to request the maximum you can definitely request less than that to be considered a build
tier as well under the scale um it's exactly what it's what it sounds
like we're looking for programs that might be a little bit more mature they know of they have or know of a proven
program model that they're really looking to scale and build off of
um scale applicants should request between 750 000 and 2 million dollars in
federal share and again has a three-year period of performance
now let's talk about ignite so ignite is a new funding level new for 2023 under
the ignite funding level which is part of the Venture challenge you can request up to three hundred thousand dollars of
federal share this does have a shorter period of performance this is really uh excuse the pun by ex ready to spark uh
your tea bed strategies regionally so it has a shorter period of performance of 18 to 24 months so up to two years on
this one um and it's really designed to focus on nascent tea bad communities so
communities that may be newer to don't have a fully comprehensive mature tea
bed strategy yet for those communities that are really looking to kick start their their communities tea bed
strategies this may be the program for you so some activities you may consider under this include like governance
partnership building Community planning for regional t-bed strategies feasibility studies Community needs
assessment impact analyzes um you know partnership really focusing on building those Partners to get a
comprehensive strategy off the ground and start implementing
now we're going to move over to the capital challenge so the capital challenge is really focused on
addressing barriers entrepreneurs face and gaining access to equity-based Capital we know that entrepreneurs one
of the biggest challenges they face is access to Capital to keep their businesses up and running so this
program is specifically designed to focus on trying to address those barriers
again check our website we have a plethora of different examples over the past nine years of
folks who've been doing this work but we've often seen programming around forming new
investment funds investor Recruitment and investor education or really
expanding existing investment funds one very very important detail about the capital challenge here is that you
cannot use funding to capitalize a fund so what can use funding for you can use funding to help support operations to
fund the operational aspects of the fund but you cannot use the funds to invest
directly into a startup so very important distinction there
under the capital challenge we have two funding tiers this may seem familiar it
does mirror The Venture challenges build and scale so we have form and deploy so under Capital challenge form you can
request up to four hundred thousand dollars of federal share over a three-year period of performance again
focused on really piloting a new model or implementing a solution um that may not be as mature
the second one deploy is funding level is four hundred thousand to seven
hundred and fifty thousand dollars over the same three year period of performance and again this is really
about scaling an existing proven model or program or expanding it
I'm showing you this slide again I know that was a lot of a lot of uh different names thrown out
there so hopefully this summarizes it well so under build the scale we have 50 million dollars
um between the Venture and capital Challenge and under each challenge we have various tiers to again focus on
meeting communities where they need it so now let's dive into the application
process so before you even get started before you open an account before you
open the application you will need at least two things one you need to locate
your organization's UEI your uniform entity identifier number
um you will need that to register in order to create an account to apply
second please make sure your organization is registered and up to date with their registration in sam.gov
this could take a couple weeks for this to process so please do this as soon as
possible first thing you should do next Once you have both of those things you're now
ready to make an account we're excited at Eda to say we have a brand new
application platform called Edge and Edge uh this is the website if you
haven't already please bookmark it all of our open funding opportunities are listed there so you can read the nofos
and apply through the system so all Eda funding will now be posted on edge as well
in addition to grants.gov so if anyone's applied in the past or you're returning grantee this will look different from
your past application experiences when you're in Edge you need to create an account and then you can start
getting started on your application and fill it out make sure you submit your application by July 28th we will not
accept late applications what's in the application so once you're
an edge there's a number of forums and places to upload forms that you will see
the first form will look familiar if you've ever applied for federal funding the sf424 is your application for
federal assistance this is basic contact information uh service area that sort of
thing separately from that we have a spot for you to upload a list of what project areas are being served under
your project what's the region you're serving and attaching your fips codes we do have some templates when you're in
Edge on the right there's a side that says resources and if you click on that it will take you to a link and you can
see all of the forms that you might need and all of the optional templates so we
do have an optional template for the project area and fips code you do not have to use it but we encourage you to
upload a document that will highlight your project area
next is the sf424a which is General budget information so this is your
overview of your budget your cost categories and your match next you will be required to upload a
copy of a cd511 which is a certification regarding lobbying attesting to your
lobbying status as an organization additional forms so again these may not
be required for all applicants the for so it's up to you to know if
your organization does need to comply with these things the first is Spock aka
the single point of contact State point Sorry State point of contact uh which is
subject to executive order one two three seven two um if your state is on what we call the
SPOC list uh if your state requires compliance with executive order one two
three seven two then you need to upload proof that you have been in compliance with that so please check and see if
your state is on the list and that your state requires this seconds if you are a
non-public entity so back to our eligibility slide that's non-profits institutions the hierarchations that are
not public entities um Federal Labs etc etc if you are a non-public entity you are required to
upload additional organizational documentation so we can verify your eligibility status so please upload a
certificate of good standing your Articles of Incorporation and your organization bylaws
if again if you are including in your budget indirect cost that is not the de
minimis you are allowed to use the diminished rate of 10 but if you have a negotiated indirect cost agreement also
known as a Negra um you will need to upload your non-expired copy here there is an upload
button for that so please include that if you are using the de minimis rate you do not need to do this
and then finally on this list if you if your
organization has lobbying activities you will need to fill out the sfll
and upload and attach that even if you don't think your lobbying activities I
still think it's worth reading this form and confirming um that you do not need it
next you will be required to upload a project narrative so what goes into your
project narrative in the please please please read the notice of funding opportunity there's a lot more description here but you have 10 pages
to upload to tell us about your project which includes a quick executive summary what
is the vision mission goals and roles for your program that you would like us to fund
what existing ecosystem resources and assets does your community already have
that you're going to Leverage What are your proposed Solutions after identifying a gap in the in the proposal
or in your community that you're trying to solve for with this funding what
Partnerships will help you get them there what are the goals and outcomes expected from this program what is your
plan to sustain the program after Federal funding is done and
we ask you to include a one-page scope of work with your Milestones of how you're going to get this program done in
the allotted period of performance here's some quick tips from nine years of this program that we've come up with
so a good project narrative should be clear and concise we don't want to make assumptions about
what you're trying to say so please make sure it's very clear and concise about what you are trying to do
make sure you're identifying a defined Gap and you're proposing a feasible strategy to address it we want very
clearly to understand what the problem is and what your solution is make sure we understand how you are
leveraging Partnerships we're going to be looking for those key milestones we are going to be looking
for metrics and proof um of the long-term impact and then of course identifying a clear and
achievable scope of work separately you'll also be asked to
submit a bra sorry a budget narrative and Staffing plan with an itemized
breakdown by year so what that looks like is this is your opportunity to kind of explain your
budget your budget should definitely align with your scope of work the cost categories in it should correspond with
the sf424a and the sf424 it should include a staffing plan with key
personnel and have again show us what your indirect costs are we do have an optional budget template
it is in Excel you don't have to use it you don't have to submit it in Excel you can submit it in word or whatever
program you want um that's readable however I do want to know if you aren't
submitting in Excel don't let that limit you you those boxes expand feel free to write more than one sentence to really
make sure that we understand what's going into your budget so that we understand that your budget is going to
support your overall goals so some key guidance to watch out for
make sure you're looking out for unallowable costs that you do not include unallowable costs we've talked
extensively about making sure that you're not giving money as a straight pass-through to
entrepreneurs or startup companies directly but make sure there are other unallowable costs as
well so check out uniform guidance to CFR 200 subpart e if you Google that it
should pop up and that's the official language on guidance from federal
allowability of funding second make sure to watch out for Budget misalignment
with the rest of the application we're really looking for a strong budget narrative and Staffing plan that's going
to support and show the feasibility and the planning that you've put into your your solution for your Region's
challenges so make sure that it is consistent with everything else in your application
next matching share commitment letters as I've noted multiple times we do have
the build-a-scale program does have a one-to-one match requirement so again every one dollar of Eda funding you
request you also need to provide one dollar in non-federal matching share
and we'll look forward to reading that in your budget and how you broke that down but in addition to how it is listed
on the three different budget forms we just talked about one of them you should also make sure to
include letters so we're looking for that backup documentation to prove that those entities are interested in
providing matching share so the letter whether it's coming from a
third party or an applicant do you still need that letter it should be signed by somebody with signatory authority uh the
letter should include whether the contribution is cash or in kind it should include evaluation and a
description particularly for any in-kind contribution so for example if somebody is providing in-kind staff time we want
to know whose staff time it is and the rate to which they are giving it and the total
expected over the course of the three years or the period of performance uh we want
to know the source for the contribution again it needs to be signed by somebody who has signatory Authority on behalf of
that organization and the letter should state that they verify that the match again whether cash
or in kind is committed to the project will be available as needed for the project and is neither conditioned or
encumbered so that it can't be used so we are looking for those kind of
three statements in the letter as well to confirm that this is a legitimate source of matching share
I do want to know and please please read the nofo which has more detail on this if there is a third party
entity that would like to eventually apply with your organization or is
trying to be a contractor under this grant they cannot contribute to ma they
cannot be a provider of matching share uh if they are a and please look up in
the nofo the definition of contractor which is different from a sub recipient um if they are a contractor under this
grant or are looking to become a contractor under this grant they cannot provide matching share they can do one
or the other you can either be a contractor or you can provide matching share if that's where you fit if you're
a sub-recipient you can do both um if you're an applicant you could do both but if you are trying to be a
Contractor on the grant you cannot provide matching share so please please read the fine print on that in the nofo
next I noted earlier that uh public and non-public entities might have slightly
different checklists I do want to know in the notice of funding opportunity in the appendix there are two separate
checklists make sure you're looking at the right one so you have the full list of what is required for your entity type
if you are a non-public entity if you are higher education institution of higher education if you are a non-profit
if you're a federal lab so and so uh you are required to submit a letter of local
or state government support what does that mean
um so a letter of support they don't have to contribute money they don't have to they just need to say that they you
know acknowledge and support your project and your application um the letter
should it the letter must come from a state or a political subdivision of a state so a
County City municipality Etc while you are
definitely allowed to include letters from other types of government or
quasi-governmental entities in order to meet this particular requirement it does need to come from a state or a political
subdivision of a state if you submit a letter from other entities such as U.S Congress
Economic Development districts councils of government Chambers of Commerce those will be read they'll be evaluating your
application but they will not meet this requirement so this is a this is a very specific requirement that
needs to be met now that we finish our application we've
submitted it uh now you want to know what you're going to be scored on well we're going to tell you if you read the
notice of funding opportunity we have the exact wording that um any mayor that will be used for merit review and how
your application will be evaluated so I encourage you to heavily read through that one a few times and make sure that
you feel like you you feel good about how that is covered in your project narrative and in your budget narrative
but separately the really quick summary of that is uh this will be weighted unequally and here
we'll be looking at how your application is leveraging ecosystem resources and assets that already exist in your
community how your proposed solution and implementation plan will be effective
does your organization and team have the capacity and feasibility to execute said
proposed solution and implementation plan uh what is the likelihood of growing
Innovation economies is this project really going to con help grow an
innovation economy uh what are the continued effects so what uh what is the lasting impact if
you will after the program has ended that you expect what does the sustainability look like there and then
finally how is your program addressing this in an equitable way how is your implementation plan taking Equity into
effect in its process
a quick highlight of some common application application mistakes the first one is
under matching as I've said multiple times we have a one-to-one match requirement so if you do not meet your
one-on-one match requirement you may be uneligible for the funding because it is required second missing documentation
again we have two checklists at the end of the notice of funding opportunity they're also on the Eda website on the
build the scale page please use these help them make sure you're not forgetting anything in your
system that you're required based on your entity type third ineligible entities if you are not
an eligible entity unfortunately we cannot uh give you funding for this grant so make sure you check that so if
you are a startup if you are a for-profit small business unfortunately
um you are not eligible for this funding at this time so please make sure you read the eligibility requirements
and finally another common application mistake we see are making sure that you
are not structuring your program as direct pass-through to companies or entrepreneurs as I've said multiple
times that is not allowed that is not a use of allowable funding so if that's what your program is doing that's going
to be an issue when it comes to scoring and selection
competition timeline so June 1st we announced the bill to skill program
applications are due July 28 2023 this is a Friday they are due at 11 59 PM
eastern time we will not accept anything after that if you submit it at 1201 we
will not accept your application it will be time stamped in this system so please make sure that you submit it early
to avoid any mishaps we expect to make award announcements in
Fall of 2023 and we expect the those selected for funding to begin their work
on November 1st to be the beginning of the period of performance
do you have any questions please check out our website at eda.gov for the
build-a-scale page in particular we have FAQs that we are updating regularly and if you can't find the answer there you
